# Dashboard Enhancement - Stacked Bar Chart Implementation

## üìä **Stacked Bar Chart Features Implemented**

### **Chart Specifications:**

-   **Axis Y:** Number of Students (jumlah siswa)
-   **Axis X:** Schedule Dates (tanggal schedule)
-   **Coloring:** Based on School Names (berdasarkan nama sekolah)
-   **Legend:** Shows school names with corresponding colors

### **Data Processing Logic:**

1. **Group by Date:** Schedules are grouped by their scheduled dates
2. **Aggregate by School:** Student counts are accumulated per school for each date
3. **Sort Chronologically:** Dates are sorted from earliest to latest
4. **Stack Formation:** Each school becomes a separate stack in the bar

### **Color Scheme:**

-   **SD Harapan Bangsa:** Blue (#3B82F6)
-   **SMP Tunas Muda:** Green (#10B981)
-   **SMA Cerdas Berkarya:** Yellow/Orange (#F59E0B)
-   **Rusunawa Cibuluh:** Red (#EF4444)

### **Sample Data Transformation:**
