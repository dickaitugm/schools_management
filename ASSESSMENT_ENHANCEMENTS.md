# Assessment Auto-Redirect & Student Profile Enhancement

## 🎯 **Changes Made**

### 1. Auto-Redirect After Save Assessment
**StudentAssessmentView.js**: Modified to automatically redirect back to schedule management after successfully saving assessments.

#### Implementation:
```javascript
if (data.success) {
  setSuccess('Assessments saved successfully!');
  // Redirect back to schedule management after a short delay
  setTimeout(() => {
    onBack();
  }, 1500);
} else {
  setError(data.error || 'Failed to save assessments');
}
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Shows success message for 1.5 seconds
- ✅ Automatically calls `onBack()` to return to schedule management
- ✅ Provides smooth user experience without requiring manual navigation

### 2. Enhanced Student Profile with Assessment Data

#### API Enhancement (students/[id]/profile/route.js)
**Added comprehensive assessment statistics:**
```javascript
// Enhanced statistics query
const statsResult = await client.query(`
  SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_teachers WHERE student_id = $1) as total_teachers,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1) as total_attendances,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND attendance_status = 'present') as present_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND attendance_status = 'absent') as absent_count,
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(knowledge_score), 2) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND knowledge_score IS NOT NULL) as avg_knowledge_score,
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(participation_score), 2) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND participation_score IS NOT NULL) as avg_participation_score,
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(personal_development_level), 2) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND personal_development_level IS NOT NULL) as avg_personal_development,
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(critical_thinking_level), 2) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND critical_thinking_level IS NOT NULL) as avg_critical_thinking,
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(team_work_level), 2) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND team_work_level IS NOT NULL) as avg_team_work,
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(academic_knowledge_level), 2) FROM student_attendance WHERE student_id = $1 AND academic_knowledge_level IS NOT NULL) as avg_academic_knowledge,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schedules s WHERE s.school_id = $2 AND s.scheduled_date >= CURRENT_DATE) as upcoming_schedules
`, [id, student.school_id]);

// New assessments query for detailed assessment history
const assessmentsResult = await client.query(`
  SELECT sa.*, s.scheduled_date, s.scheduled_time,
    sch.name as school_name,
    array_agg(DISTINCT t.name) as teacher_names,
    array_agg(DISTINCT l.title) as lesson_titles
  FROM student_attendance sa
  JOIN schedules s ON sa.schedule_id = s.id
  JOIN schools sch ON s.school_id = sch.id
  LEFT JOIN schedule_teachers st ON s.id = st.schedule_id
  LEFT JOIN teachers t ON st.teacher_id = t.id
  LEFT JOIN schedule_lessons sl ON s.id = sl.schedule_id
  LEFT JOIN lessons l ON sl.lesson_id = l.id
  WHERE sa.student_id = $1 AND (
    sa.knowledge_score IS NOT NULL OR 
    sa.participation_score IS NOT NULL OR 
    sa.personal_development_level IS NOT NULL OR 
    sa.critical_thinking_level IS NOT NULL OR 
    sa.team_work_level IS NOT NULL OR 
    sa.academic_knowledge_level IS NOT NULL
  )
  GROUP BY sa.id, s.id, sch.name
  ORDER BY s.scheduled_date DESC, s.scheduled_time DESC
  LIMIT 10
`, [id]);
```

#### ProfileView.js Enhancement

- **Attendance Rate**: Green theme
- **Knowledge Score**: Blue theme  
- **Participation Score**: Purple theme
- **Personal Development**: Indigo theme

**New Assessment History Section:**
```javascript
{/* Assessment History */}
{profile.assessments && profile.assessments.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-6">
    <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 flex items-center">
      <span className="text-indigo-600 mr-2">📊</span>
      Assessment History
    </h4>
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {profile.assessments.slice(0, 5).map((assessment) => (
        <div key={assessment.id} className="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-50 to-purple-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-indigo-200">
          // ... detailed assessment display
